```

In this walk through, we will be creating a "player report card" using `cbbdata` and `gt`. The goal of this "report card" is to effectively visualize a player's performance across certain statistics relative to their position group.

## Data Selection

First up, we need to choose which data to include in our report. You can swap out anything in the `stat` column for any variable found in `cbd_torvik_player_season`. (This *is* true, but you might have to change one small thing later on.) I don't want this report to be particularly long, so I'm not going to pick a ton here.

We don't want our report to show `mpg`, `ppg`, `oreb`, etc. Instead, we want to give our table readable variable names, and those are going to be placed in a `plot_name` column. We also want to "segment" our report by grouping our categories, and we are going to do that by assigning `group` names in our tibble.

```{r}
cols_to_plot <- tibble(
  stat = c('mpg', 'ppg', 'oreb', 'dreb', 'rpg', 'bpg', 'apg', 'spg', 'tov', 'efg', 'three_pct', 'ft_pct', 'three_rate', 'ortg', 'drtg', 'usg', 'porpag'),
  plot_name = c('Minutes', 'Points', 'Off. Rebounds', 'Def. Rebounds', 'Rebounds', 'Blocks', 'Assists', 'Steals', 'Turnovers', 'eFG%', '3FG%', 'FT%', '3FGA/FGA', 'Off. Rating', 'Def. Rating', 'Usage', 'PORPAG'),
  group = c(rep('Box (Per-Game)', 9), rep('Shooting', 4), rep('Advanced', 4))
)
```

### Compute percentiles and grab player data

Next up, we need to compute the percentiles that we will be plotting. **An important note: If you did add or change a `stat` column, think in which "direction" that stat is measured.** In other words, *fewer* turnovers per game is good. A *lower* defensive rating is better. If your new `stat` also follows this logic, add it to the `reverse_cols` vector in the code below. This will subtract 1 from the percentile value, returning the "proper" percentile.

The `get_season_percentiles` function computes percentiles on a national *and* "conference group" level. It also categorizes players into three broad position groups -- 'guards,' 'wings,' and 'bigs' -- which is determined by their position listing in `cbbdata` (from Barttorvik). The percentiles are also computed relative to these position groups for both of the above groupings.

```{r}
season_averages <- cbd_torvik_player_season(year = 2024)

get_season_percentiles <- function(min_cutoff, games_cutoff, cols_to_plot = cols_to_plot) {
  
  hm <- c('ACC', 'BE', 'B10', 'B12', 'P12', 'SEC')
  mm <- c('MWC', 'A10', 'Amer', 'MVC', 'WCC', 'Ivy', 'CUSA', 'SC')
  reverse_cols <- c('tov_', 'drtg_')
  
  ptiles <- season_averages %>% 
    mutate(fg_pct = fgm / fga, three_pct = three_m / three_a, ft_pct = ftm / fta,
           efg = (0.5 * three_m + fgm) / fga, three_rate = (three_a / fga) * 100,
           conf_group = case_when(conf %in% hm ~ 'High-Majors', conf %in% mm ~ 'Mid-Majors',
                                  .default = 'Low-Majors'),
           pos_group = case_when(pos %in% c('Combo G', 'Pure PG', 'Scoring PG') ~ 'guards',
                                 pos %in% c('Wing F', 'Wing G', 'Stretch 4') ~ 'wings',
                                 pos %in% c('C', 'PF/C') ~ 'bigs')) %>% 
    filter(min >= min_cutoff & g >= games_cutoff) %>% 
    select(all_of(c('player', 'team', 'conf', 'conf_group', 'pos_group', cols_to_plot$stat))) %>%
    mutate(across(-c(player, team), percent_rank, .names = '{.col}_ptile'), .by = pos_group) %>% 
    mutate(across(-c(player, team), percent_rank, .names = '{.col}_conf_ptile'),
           .by = c(conf_group, pos_group)) %>% 
    # subtract 1 from reverse cols
    mutate(across(all_of(starts_with(reverse_cols)), ~1 - .x))
  
  return(ptiles)
  
}
```

Next up, we are defining a function, `get_player`, that takes a player and team name and then returns that players' percentile rankings for the requested stats. This will serve as our "helper function" to grab the plotting data later on.

The "tricky" part about this function is its pivoting. We first pivot the data to a *long* format so that we can separate percentile from raw statistical value, both of which will be plotted. We do that separation by using `extract` and a regex string that identifies columns ending with "_ptile" and "_conf_ptile" as percentiles.

We are also defining some broad "grading" system. I went back and forth on whether this was needed, but I really dig the idea of including grades on a player "report card." It's true that <=59 is seen as "failing" in many parts of the country, but it's not fair to say that a player who is in the 50th percentile in scoring is "bad." Feel free to play around with the grade scale if you wish (or just remove it all together).

```{r}
get_player <- function(player, team, season_percentiles = NULL, min_cutoff = NULL, games_cutoff = NULL) {
  
  if(is.null(season_percentiles)) {
    season_percentiles <- get_season_percentiles(min_cutoff = min_cutoff,
                                                 games_cutoff = games_cutoff,
                                                 cols_to_plot)
  }
  
  reverse_cols <- c('tov', 'drtg')
  
  player_data <- season_percentiles %>% 
    # add raw ranks to season percentiles
    mutate(across(cols_to_plot$stat, ~dense_rank(-.x), .names = '{.col}_rank'),
       .by = conf) %>% 
    mutate(across(reverse_cols, ~dense_rank(.x), .names = '{.col}_rank'),
       .by = conf) %>% 
    filter(player == !!player & team == !!team) %>% 
    pivot_longer(cols = -c(player, team, conf, conf_group, pos_group), names_to = "variable", values_to = "value") %>% 
    extract(variable, into = c("stat", "measure"), "^(.+?)(?:_(ptile|conf_ptile|rank))?$") %>% 
    mutate(measure = ifelse(measure == '', 'raw', measure)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(id_cols = c(player, team, conf_group, pos_group, stat), names_from = measure, values_from = value) %>%
    left_join(cols_to_plot, by = 'stat') %>% 
    filter(!is.na(ptile) & !is.na(conf_ptile) & !is.na(plot_name)) %>% 
    mutate(
        natl_grade = case_when(
        ptile >= 0.95 ~ "A+",
        ptile >= 0.90 ~ "A",
        ptile >= 0.85 ~ "A-",
        ptile >= 0.80 ~ "B+",
        ptile >= 0.75 ~ "B",
        ptile >= 0.70 ~ "B-",
        ptile >= 0.65 ~ "C+",
        ptile >= 0.60 ~ "C",
        ptile >= 0.55 ~ "C-",
        ptile >= 0.50 ~ "D+",
        ptile >= 0.45 ~ "D",
        ptile >= 0.40 ~ "D-",
        .default = "F"
      )
  )
  return(player_data)
  
}
```

## Plotting

That's all of the data that we need! Now for the fun part, plotting! This code is going to make use of a function that I pushed as a PR for `gtExtras`. That PR was accepted, and baked into `gt_plt_bar_pct`, but only partially. Importantly, some of the functionality that we are going to use in this code did not make it into the package.

We can load that function into our environment by "sourcing" a gist of it. In a nutshell, this function is going to allow us to add labels and a domain to bar plots included in our table.

```{r}
source('https://gist.github.com/andreweatherman/0a81c7122a133a015583587573a123ff/raw/4cd6b9db1d39c46e1b93b069bc801e4eac846b19/gt_plt_bar_pct.R')
```

Now for the `plot_player_report` function. This function makes use of the fact that `gt` is built on HTML, and as such, we can define a header with the player's name *and* their team logo. You can see how that is done below. It's just mashing together HTML and `glue`.

Aside from that, this `gt` code is relatively straightforward. I like the `gt_theme_538` table theme, but to give our report a bit of spice, I am changing the table font from Chivo to PT Sans.

```{r}
plot_player_report <- function(player, team) {

  # get team color and logo for plotting
  team_data <- cbd_teams() %>% filter(torvik_team == team)
  player_data <- get_player(player, team, min_cutoff = 40, games_cutoff = 5)
  conf_group <- player_data$conf_group %>% unique()
  pos_group <- player_data$pos_group %>% unique()
  
  font <- 'PT Sans'
  to_scale_percent <- which(player_data$stat %in% c('efg', 'three_pct', 'ft_pct'))
  to_scale_number <- setdiff(1:nrow(player_data), to_scale_percent)
  
  title_text = glue('Player Report Card: {player}')
  subtitle_text = glue('Position groups are determined by Barttorvik. Data through {format(Sys.Date(), "%b %e, %Y")}')
  
  title_header <- glue(
    "<div style='display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;'>
     <div style='flex-grow: 1;'>
       <span style='font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px; line-height: 0.5;'>{title_text}</span><br>
       <span style='font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 0.5;'>{subtitle_text}</span>
     </div>
     <div>
       <img src='{team_data$logo}' style='height: 65px; width: auto; vertical-align: middle;'>
     </div>
   </div>"
  )
  
  table <- player_data %>% 
    group_by(group) %>% 
    gt(id = 'player_report') %>% 
    gt_theme_538() %>% 
    cols_hide(c(player, team, stat, conf_group, pos_group, natl_grade)) %>% 
    cols_move_to_start(plot_name) %>%

    cols_align(columns = c(plot_name), 'left') %>% 
    gt_bars(ptile, labels = TRUE, fill = team_data$color, domain = 0:1, digits = 0) %>% 
    gt_bars(conf_ptile, labels = TRUE, fill = team_data$color, domain = 0:1, digits = 0) %>% 
    fmt_percent(columns = raw, rows = to_scale_percent, decimals = 1) %>% 
    fmt_number(columns = raw, rows = to_scale_number, decimals = 1) %>% 
    gt_add_divider(raw, color = 'black', include_labels = FALSE) %>% 
    gt_add_divider(conf_ptile, color = 'black', include_labels = FALSE) %>% 
    cols_label(plot_name = 'Stat', raw = 'Value', ptile = 'National', conf_ptile = conf_group, rank = 'Conf. Rank') %>% 
    # bold stat name and value
    tab_style(locations = cells_row_groups(), style = cell_text(weight = 'bold')) %>%
    # change group headings
    tab_style(locations = cells_row_groups(), style = list(cell_fill(color = 'grey90'),cell_text(font = google_font(font)))) %>%
    tab_style(locations = list(cells_title('title'), cells_source_notes()), style = cell_text(font = google_font(font))) %>% 
    tab_style(locations = cells_body(), style = cell_text(font = google_font(font), weight = 400)) %>% 
    tab_style(locations = cells_body(columns = c(raw, plot_name, natl_grade)), style = cell_text(font = google_font(font), weight = 'bold')) %>% 
    tab_style(locations = list(cells_column_labels(), cells_column_spanners()), 
              style = cell_text(font = google_font(font))) %>% 
    tab_spanner(columns = ends_with('ptile'), label = glue('Percentile relative to {pos_group} across...')) %>% 
    tab_options(data_row.padding = 3.5) %>% 
    # footnotes for specific stats
    tab_footnote(locations = cells_body(columns = plot_name, row = which(player_data$plot_name == '3FGA/FGA')),
                 footnote = "3FG attempts per 100 FGA") %>% 
    tab_footnote(locations = cells_body(columns = plot_name, row = which(player_data$plot_name == 'Off. Rating')),
                 footnote = "Offensive and defensive ratings represent points scored/allowed per 100 possessions") %>% 
    tab_footnote(locations = cells_body(columns = plot_name, row = which(player_data$plot_name == 'PORPAG')),
                 footnote = "PORPAG represents points above replacement player at that usage") %>% 
    tab_header(title = html(title_header)) %>% 
    tab_source_note(source_note = md('Data by cbbdata<br>Viz. + Analysis by @andreweatherman')) %>% 
    opt_css(
      '
      #player_report .gt_sourcenote{
        line-height: 1.2;
        padding-top: 9px !important;
      }
      #player_report .gt_group_heading {
        padding-top: 5px !important;
        padding-bottom: 5px !important;
      }
      #player_report .gt_footnote {

        line-height: 0.2;
      }
      '
    )
  
  return(table)
  
}
```

Finally, let's save an image of it. Remember that we can use the `magick` package to automatically trim and crop our table post-save.

```{r}
crop_gt <- function(file, whitespace) {
  image_read(file) %>% 
    image_trim() %>% 
    image_border("white", glue('{whitespace}x{whitespace}')) %>% 
    image_write(file)
}

gtsave_extra(plot_player_report('Kyle Filipowski', 'Duke'), here('player_report', 'Filipowski_report.png'), zoom = 3)
crop_gt(here('player_report', 'Filipowski_report.png'), '40')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics(here('player_report', 'Filipowski_report.png'))
```
